Image Analysis
==============

Purpose
-------
This code is designed to store and process the data from the camera that
images the MOT.

To Do:
------
  * Add colorbar bounds control to GUI
  * Make Image_Array have nicer behavior when there are no files with the given name
  * Add GUI input for colorbar bounds on plots
  * Add Image_Array.update_metadata() to add metadata to self and all images in self.image_array
  * Image_Series class?


  Image_Series Class:
  *Maybe findobj() would be perfect for filtering
  *Sort by properties

 Hierarchy:
 *Image_series (not yet implemented)
   *Image_Array
       *Image
